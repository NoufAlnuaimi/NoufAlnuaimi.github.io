# 1st assignment:
## the making of a 30MFF site
### The process of picking what to film:
#### -we wanted something that would involve all 4 of us so we decided to create something over zoom. 
#### -to align with the fact that we were put into breakout rooms, we settled to create something that revolves around that. 
#### -to make it a little funnier, we decided to be random object! 
### The website:
#### because the film was very random and a little confusing, i decided on a funky website. 
### What i went with:
#### -bright-ish spring colors to keep it fun. 
#### -font that wasn’t too formal and not too childish just to keep up with the sarcastic  film that had a serious look to be confusing. 
#### -pages that were mostly empty to stay vague and to keep the viewer engaged.
### -Things i learnt:
#### - truly endless possibilities with the things you can do with css and javascript. 
#### -because it’s broken down into html, css, and javascript, it was easy to navigate through making it more fun. 
### Things i want to look further into:
#### -grids and the resizing elements.
